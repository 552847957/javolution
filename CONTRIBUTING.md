## Javolution Contribution Guide

Contributions from the community are welcomed and encouraged.

Javolution's primary repository is located at java.net and is still using subversion. Git mirrors are provided using [TMateSoft's SubGit product](http://www.subgit.com/), which handles bidirectional mirroring between subversion and git

If you'd like to contribute, you have several options:

1. GitHub Users: Open a pull request. After it is merged, it will should get synced over to SVN within 15 minutes.
2. GitLab or Bitbucket Users: You can submit relatively easily through @starlightknight's [GitLab Server](https://cloud.slkdev.net/gitlab/). If you sign in with OmniAuth you can import your change from GitLab Central or Bitbucket and then open a merge request. This server is repsonsible for the SVN/Git sync up and your change will be automatically submitted to subversion and mirrored back to GitHub once approved.
3. Subversion Users: You are welcome to send a patch file to the mailing list, or link to one in an issue.

We hope you consider contributing :-)
